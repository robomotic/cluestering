Installation
-------------------------
Nothing really to do here

Usage
-------------------------
For the help:
<pre>
./multimistserial.py -h
</pre>

If you want to *generate reports* from a folder containing CWS sequential XML files:
<pre>
 ./multimistserial.py -r -v data/small-seq/
</pre>
If you want to *learn the embedding rule* from a folder containing CWS sequential XML files and MIST reports:
<pre>
 ./multimistserial.py -l -v -m data/small-mist/ data/small-seq/
</pre>
This will save a dat file in the same script folder that contains the syscall binding associations.
